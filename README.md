# Earthquake Visualization with Leaflet

This project visualizes earthquake data using Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps. It displays earthquake locations, magnitudes, and depths on an interactive map, with markers sized and colored according to earthquake magnitude and depth, respectively. Additionally, tectonic plate boundaries can be displayed on the map for additional context.

## Features
- Plot earthquake locations on an interactive map
- Size markers according to earthquake magnitude
- Color markers according to earthquake depth
- Display tectonic plate boundaries on the map
- Popups show additional information about each earthquake

## Technologies Used
- Leaflet: JavaScript library for interactive maps
- D3.js: JavaScript library for data visualization
- HTML/CSS: Structuring and styling the web page

## Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage
Once the project is set up and running, you can interact with the map to explore earthquake data:
- Click on markers to view additional information about each earthquake, including location, magnitude, and depth.
- Use the layer control in the top-right corner to toggle the display of tectonic plate boundaries.
